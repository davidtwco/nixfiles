# Hello!
I'm David, a software engineer from Scotland, with an interest in systems software and open source
software. You'll find me as `davidtwco` around the internet.

## Open Source
Contributing to open source is a lot of fun and I love doing it - I'm a [member of the Rust compiler
team][compiler_team_member], so I mostly contribute to the compiler for the Rust programming
language. Throughout my time contributing, I've been a member of the
[non-lexical lifetimes (NLL)][wg_nll], [async/await][wg_async_await] and
[diagnostics][wg_diagnostics] working groups and have been a co-lead of the
[polymorphisation][wg_polymorphisation] and [meta][wg_meta] working groups. My contributions have
included the [`#[non_exhaustive]` attribute from RFC 2008][rfc_2008]; polymorphisation, a
code-size/compile-time optimisation for reducing unnecessary monomorphisation; and Split DWARF
support.

I've also contributed to other open source projects, such as NixOS - a reproducible Linux
distribution - and Zulip - a real-time chat application with threading. You can find [an exhaustive
list of my open source contributions on GitHub][prs].

## Personal Infrastructure
I love investing in things that will pay off in the long-term, so I've maintained a dotfiles
repository for years. The most recent manifestation of this is [`veritas`][veritas], my personal
mono-repo which contains the declarative configuration for all of my desktops, servers and laptops
- including dotfiles, packages and this website!

## Work
I work within the infrastructure team at [Codeplay Software][codeplay], where I'm
responsible for the continuous integration infrastructure and lead the effort to make the core
infrastructure reproducible. In addition, I've been a compiler engineer on engineering projects at
Codeplay where I've worked with LLVM, Clang, SPIR-V and NVPTX. You can download [my curriculum
vitae here](/curriculum_vitae.pdf).

## Contact
If you'd like to chat, send me a message [on Keybase][keybase] or shoot me an email at
[`hello@davidtw.co`][email] (my PGP key is [`0x9F53F154`][keybase], if you need it).
